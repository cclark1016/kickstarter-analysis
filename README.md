### The purpose of this project is to use Kickstarter data to understand how different fundraising campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. This will help Louise understand how her campaign fared in relation to others with similar characteristics. It may also help identify if any adjustments should be made to future theatre fundraising strategies.
